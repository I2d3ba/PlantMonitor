# PlantMonitor
Plant monitor is a multiplatform app made for tracking the watering, fertilizing and transplanting many plants at the same time.

I am currently working on the development while learning required technologies, like:
- .NET MAUI
- Entity Framework
  
Here are some features i work on adding:
- clean managment of added plants
- good notification system for different platforms
- //someday, a wireless connection to a soil humidity sensor for in real time updates about the plant needs
